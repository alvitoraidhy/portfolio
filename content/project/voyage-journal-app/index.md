Voyage Journal App is an account-based journal web application. This web application was created as a warm-up for applying to [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) Tier-3 Voyage 36.

The web application consists of two repositories: [the front-end repository](https://github.com/alvitoraidhy/voyage-journal-app-backend) and [the back-end repository](https://github.com/alvitoraidhy/voyage-journal-app-frontend). The front-end is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Node.js) and the back-end is based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python). The web application is hosted on Heroku and available for public [here](https://voyage-journal-app-frontend.herokuapp.com/).
