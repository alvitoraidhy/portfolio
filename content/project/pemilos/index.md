Pemilos is an online election web application. It was initially made specifically to be used for student council president elections. The application was used by SMAN 8 Bandung (my alma mater) for their student council, also known as "OSIS", president election in 2020 with over 1000 vote participants. My role in the project was as the sole, full-stack web developer.

Tech Stack:

* Python: Sanic, Jinja2, Tortoise ORM, WTForms
* PostgreSQL (for production)
* SQLite (for development)
