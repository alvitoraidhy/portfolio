Web Absen ("Attendance Website" in English) is an attendance recorder web application that was used in 2019 to 2020 by an ICT extracurricular club in SMAN 8 Bandung for their members. It was a collaborative project between the members of the club. My role in the project was as the back-end web developer.

Tech Stack:

* Node.js: Express, Sequelize, EJS
